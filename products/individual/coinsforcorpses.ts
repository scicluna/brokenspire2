    summary: "The players venture into the quaint hamlet of Ravenbrook, where a shadow looms large in the form of a menacing bandit group known as The Reapers. Designed for a team of four intrepid level two adventurers, this module weaves a tale of intrigue, betrayal, and dark alliances.\n\nAmid the rustic charm of Ravenbrook lie hidden secrets. While the townspeople go about their daily lives, some among them clandestinely align with The Reapers. To unearth the truth, players must sift through clues, engage with the local NPCs, each bearing their own motivations and insights, and unmask a traitor in their midst. This treacherous path  guides the adventurers to The Reapersâ€™ den, Briarheart Hideaway, in the dense Briarheart Forest or confront a deadly ambush along the roads.\n\nFrom Briarheart Hideaway's decrepit structures emerge unsettling mysteries: unaccounted for corpses, eerie zombie horses, and an unexpected ghoul envoy. These anomalies hint at a nefarious alliance between the bandits and a dark, arcane power.\n\nCoins for Corpses carefully blends elements of mystery, exploration, social dynamics, and intense combat, promising adventurers a riveting journey filled with suspense and surprises.
